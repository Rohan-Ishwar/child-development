        <p>Here are some key details about infancy</p>
        <ol>
          <li>
            <strong>Growth:</strong> Infants experience rapid physical growth
            during this stage. They typically double their birth weight by
            around six months and triple it by their first birthday. Motor
            skills also develop, starting with simple reflexes and progressing
            to activities like crawling and eventually walking.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Cognitive Development: </strong> Cognitive development in
            infancy is marked by significant progress in sensory perception,
            memory, and problem-solving. Infants begin to recognize faces,
            imitate sounds, and show curiosity about their environment.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Emotional Development: </strong> Infants develop emotional
            bonds with their caregivers, often forming strong attachments. This
            is essential for their emotional well-being and future social
            development. Crying is their primary means of communication.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Language Development: </strong> Infants start to babble and
            make cooing sounds, which are early steps in language development.
            They are receptive to the language spoken around them and begin to
            understand basic words and phrases.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong> Feeding and Nutrition:</strong> Breastfeeding or formula
            feeding provides essential nutrients for growth. Introduction to
            solid foods typically begins around six months of age.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong> Sleep Patterns:</strong> Infants have irregular sleep
            patterns and require frequent naps. As they grow, sleep patterns
            gradually become more consistent.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Social Interaction: </strong> Infants learn about social
            interactions by observing and interacting with their caregivers.
            Smiling and responding to facial expressions are early signs of
            social awareness.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong>Sensorimotor Stage: </strong> According to Jean Piaget's
            theory of cognitive development, infants are in the sensorimotor
            stage during this period. They learn about the world through sensory
            experiences and gradually develop the concept of object permanence,
            realizing that objects continue to exist even when they can't see
            them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Health and Care: </strong> Regular check-ups, vaccinations,
            and proper care are crucial for infant health. Sudden Infant Death
            Syndrome (SIDS) is a concern during this stage, so safe sleeping
            practices are emphasized.
          </li>

          <li>
            <strong> Milestones:</strong> Infants achieve various developmental
            milestones, such as rolling over, sitting up, and saying their first
            words, at different rates. These milestones are general guidelines
            and can vary among individuals.

            <p>
              Infancy is a critical period of growth and development that lays
              the foundation for a child's future physical, cognitive, and
              emotional development. It's a time when caregivers play a vital
              role in providing love, support, and a nurturing environment for
              the child's well-being.
